Graph Convolutional Networks
This is a TensorFlow implementation of Graph Convolutional Networks for the task of (semi-supervised) classification of nodes in a graph, as described in our paper:

Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks (ICLR 2017)

For a high-level explanation, have a look at our blog post:

Thomas Kipf, Graph Convolutional Networks (2016)

Installation
python setup.py install
Requirements
tensorflow (>0.12)
networkx
Run the demo
cd gcn
python train.py
Data
In order to use your own data, you have to provide

an N by N adjacency matrix (N is the number of nodes),
an N by D feature matrix (D is the number of features per node), and
an N by E binary label matrix (E is the number of classes).
Have a look at the load_data() function in utils.py for an example.

In this example, we load citation network data (Cora, Citeseer or Pubmed). The original datasets can be found here: http://www.cs.umd.edu/~sen/lbc-proj/LBC.html. In our version (see data folder) we use dataset splits provided by https://github.com/kimiyoung/planetoid (Zhilin Yang, William W. Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings, ICML 2016).

You can specify a dataset as follows:

python train.py --dataset citeseer
(or by editing train.py)

Models
You can choose between the following models:

gcn: Graph convolutional network (Thomas N. Kipf, Max Welling, Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks, 2016)
gcn_cheby: Chebyshev polynomial version of graph convolutional network as described in (MichaÃ«l Defferrard, Xavier Bresson, Pierre Vandergheynst, Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering, NIPS 2016)
dense: Basic multi-layer perceptron that supports sparse inputs
Graph classification
Our framework also supports batch-wise classification of multiple graph instances (of potentially different size) with an adjacency matrix each. It is best to concatenate respective feature matrices and build a (sparse) block-diagonal matrix where each block corresponds to the adjacency matrix of one graph instance. For pooling (in case of graph-level outputs as opposed to node-level outputs) it is best to specify a simple pooling matrix that collects features from their respective graph instances, as illustrated below:
